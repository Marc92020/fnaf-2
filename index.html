    <h1>Five Nights at Freddy's 2 Remake</h1>
    <p>This site hosts a near 100% accurate recreation of Scott Cawthon's 2014 game Five Night's at Freddy's 2. I don't know what else to write about this right now so I'll just give you the game</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Version differences</h2>
    <p>There are 2 versions of this game, and while they are mostly the same, you must choose which version is best for your device.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Which version should I play?</h2>
    <h3>Normal Version</h3>
      <p>Assets are lower quality, but could run on slower devices</p>
    <h3>High Quality Version</h3>
      <p>Assets are very high quality, and the game may not run on slower devices</p>
    <br>
    <p>If you're playing on a school Chromebook you should use the normal version (if that'll even load)</p>
    <br>
